# giphy-api

Created an array of strings & saved it to a variable.

App takes the topics in this array and create buttons in HTML.

Using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Under every gif, displaying its rating (PG, G, so on).

Added a form to page which takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the array, making related new button to be used.

Softwares : HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery

Challenges : Making images stop and play when user clicks on it.

Solution : W3schools.com was a big help for most of the issues.
